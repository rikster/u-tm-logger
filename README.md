## Technologies
- React https://reactjs.org/
  - create-react-app https://create-react-app.dev/
  - npx create-react-app . (install in current dir)
- Redux https://redux.js.org/
  - state management
- Json-server https://github.com/typicode/json-server
  - a great way to mock up a REST based API quickly
  - CRUD, filter, search,etc
  - npm i -D json-server
- Materialize CSS https://materializecss.com/
  - similar to Bootstrap, perhaps nicer looking imo
  - could use Material-UI, which is Materialize converted into React
  - npm i materialize-css
  components, however:
    - it uses too much code, too many imports, state etc
    - not very either  
    - NOT a fan of css in react components in General, rather be closer to the metal.
